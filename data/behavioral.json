      "question": "Tell me about yourself",
      "answer": "**Structure**: Present → Past → Future\n\n**Example**:\n'Currently, I'm a Full Stack Developer at Freshen, working with React Native and Spring Boot to build mobile applications. Previously, I spent 5+ years at webNanny developing enterprise solutions, where I gained deep expertise in Java and microservices architecture. I recently completed my PG Diploma from BUET with 90+ scores in Software Engineering and DSA. I'm passionate about building scalable systems and recently published my own app, SmartList, on Google Play. I'm excited about this opportunity because...'",

      "question": "What is your greatest strength?",
      "answer": "**Choose relevant strength** and provide evidence.\n\n**Example**:\n'My greatest strength is problem-solving, especially in distributed systems. At webNanny, I redesigned our microservices communication pattern, reducing API response time by 40%. I used message queues to decouple services and implemented circuit breakers for fault tolerance. This experience taught me to analyze complex problems systematically and find elegant solutions. I'm always looking for ways to optimize and improve systems.'",

      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is your greatest weakness?",
      "answer": "**Be honest but show improvement**.\n\n**Example**:\n'I tend to be a perfectionist, which sometimes slows me down. Early in my career, I'd spend too much time optimizing code that didn't need it. I've learned to prioritize and focus on business impact first. Now I follow the 80/20 rule - deliver working solution quickly, then iterate. I also use code reviews to get feedback early rather than polishing alone. This has made me much more efficient while maintaining quality.'",
      "explanation": "Avoid clichés like 'I work too hard'. Choose a real weakness and demonstrate self-awareness and growth. Show how you're actively working on it with concrete steps.",

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "How do you handle tight deadlines?",
      "answer": "**Prioritization + Communication**\n\n**Example**:\n'When faced with tight deadlines, I first clarify requirements and identify MVP features versus nice-to-haves. I break the work into tasks and estimate effort realistically. If the deadline is truly unrealistic, I communicate early with stakeholders to adjust scope or timeline. During a product launch at webNanny, we had 2 weeks for 4 weeks of work. I negotiated to push 3 features to v2, implemented core features with automated tests, and we launched on time with quality. The deferred features were added in the next sprint.'",
      "explanation": "Show you're organized, communicate proactively, and balance speed with quality. Demonstrate ability to say no to unrealistic expectations while finding solutions. Avoid saying you just work longer hours.",

      "id": 6,
      "question": "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a team member or manager",
      "answer": "**Show respect, reasoning, and resolution**\n\n**Example**:\n'At webNanny, my manager wanted to use MongoDB for our transaction-heavy order system. I believed PostgreSQL was better due to ACID guarantees. I scheduled a meeting, presented a comparison document showing trade-offs, explained why consistency was critical for financial data, and suggested a proof-of-concept. We tested both, and the data showed PostgreSQL reduced inconsistency errors to near zero. My manager appreciated the thorough analysis, and we went with PostgreSQL. It taught me the value of data-driven discussions.'",
      "explanation": "Never badmouth anyone. Show you can disagree respectfully, back opinions with data, listen to others, and reach collaborative decisions. Focus on the resolution and what you learned.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Describe a time you failed",
      "answer": "**Honest failure + Learning**\n\n**Example**:\n'In my first year at webNanny, I deployed a feature without proper load testing. Within hours of release, our API started timing out due to an N+1 query problem under high load. I quickly rolled back, spent the evening optimizing queries and adding database indexes, and redeployed the next day. Since then, I always do performance testing before deployment and have a rollback plan ready. I also created a checklist for our team that includes load testing. This failure made me a more careful and thorough developer.'",

      "id": 8,
      "question": "How do you handle stress or pressure?",
      "answer": "**Coping mechanisms + Example**\n\n**Example**:\n'I stay calm by breaking problems into manageable pieces and focusing on what I can control. During a production outage at Freshen affecting 10,000 users, I stayed focused: checked logs, identified the issue (database connection pool exhausted), increased pool size temporarily, then implemented proper connection management. I also communicated updates to stakeholders every 30 minutes. After resolution, I documented the incident and improved our monitoring. I find that having a systematic approach and clear communication reduces stress significantly.'",

      "question": "Tell me about a time you showed leadership",
      "answer": "**Leadership without title**\n\n**Example**:\n'Though not formally a team lead, I took initiative when our team struggled with code quality. I noticed repetitive bugs and inconsistent patterns. I proposed and organized weekly code review sessions, created coding guidelines, and mentored 2 junior developers on best practices. I also introduced automated linting and pre-commit hooks. Over 3 months, our bug count decreased by 35%, and code review became a positive learning culture rather than criticism. This showed me that leadership is about influence and initiative, not just titles.'",

      "question": "Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly",
      "answer": "**Fast learning + Application**\n\n**Example**:\n'At Freshen, we decided to migrate from REST to GraphQL for our mobile API. I had no GraphQL experience and had 2 weeks to implement it. I spent the first 3 days on intensive learning - official docs, tutorials, and a Udemy course. Then I built a small prototype to understand resolvers, schemas, and N+1 query problems. I implemented our first GraphQL endpoint, wrote tests, and documented patterns for the team. By the deadline, we had 5 endpoints migrated. My quick learning approach - theory first, then practical application - proved effective.'",

      "question": "How do you handle feedback or criticism?",
      "answer": "**Positive attitude + Growth mindset**\n\n**Example**:\n'I view feedback as an opportunity to improve. During a code review, a senior developer pointed out that my API design wasn't RESTful and had security vulnerabilities. Instead of being defensive, I asked questions to understand better and researched best practices. I refactored the code and thanked them for the detailed feedback. I even created a document on API design guidelines for our team. That feedback made me a better developer. I actively seek feedback during 1-on-1s because external perspective helps identify blind spots.'",

      "question": "Describe a time you worked with a difficult person",
      "answer": "**Diplomacy + Problem-solving**\n\n**Example**:\n'I worked with a colleague who was very critical in code reviews, often rejecting PRs without constructive feedback. Instead of complaining, I scheduled a coffee chat to understand their perspective. I learned they had high standards from past experiences with bugs. I suggested a compromise: I'd write more detailed PR descriptions explaining my decisions, and they'd provide specific feedback instead of just 'this is wrong'. We also paired on a feature to align on standards. Our relationship improved significantly, and code reviews became collaborative rather than confrontational.'",

      "id": 18,
      "question": "How do you prioritize tasks when everything is urgent?",
      "answer": "**Framework + Communication**\n\n**Example**:\n'I use a priority matrix: Impact vs Effort. I also clarify true urgency with stakeholders - often 'urgent' means 'I want it soon' rather than 'business is blocked'. At webNanny, I once had 4 'urgent' tasks. I listed them with estimated effort and business impact, discussed with my manager, and we agreed on order: P0 bug fix (blocking users), then API for partner integration (contract deadline), then feature request (nice-to-have). I communicated timelines transparently to stakeholders. This approach prevents thrashing and ensures high-impact work gets done first.'",

      "answer": "**Extra effort + Impact**\n\n**Example**:\n'During a critical release at Freshen, we discovered a data migration issue at 6 PM on Friday. The team was exhausted and wanted to postpone. I volunteered to stay and fix it because Monday's launch was promised to clients. I worked until midnight, wrote a safe migration script with rollback plan, tested thoroughly in staging, and executed in production. I documented everything for the team. Monday's launch was successful. My manager recognized this effort, but more importantly, we kept our commitment to clients. I believe ownership means doing what's necessary, even when it's inconvenient.'",
